    "### A. Functions:\n",
    "* `gaussian_smooth()`: filter images with Gaussian blur.\n",
    "* `sobel_edge_detection()`: apply the Sobel filters to the blurred images and compute the magnitude and direction of gradient. (You should eliminate weak gradients by proper threshold.)\n",
    "* `structure_tensor()`: use the gradient magnitude above to compute the structure tensor (second-moment matrix).\n",
    "* `nms()`: perform non-maximal suppression on the results above along with appropriate threshold for corner detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Results:\n",
    "* a. Original image\n",
    "    * i. Gaussian smooth results: ùúé=5 and kernel size=5 and 10 (**2 images**)\n",
    "    * ii. Sobel edge detection results\n",
    "     * (1) magnitude of gradient (Gaussian kernel size=5 and 10) (**2 images**)\n",
    "     * (2) direction of gradient (Gaussian kernel size=5 and 10) (**2 images**)\n",
    "        (You can choose arbitrary color map to display)\n",
    "    * iii. Structure tensor + NMS results (Gaussian kernel size=10)\n",
    "     * (1) window size = 3x3 (**1 image**)\n",
    "     * (2) window size = 30x30 (**1 image**)\n",
    "* b. Final results of rotating (by 30¬∞) original images (**1 image**)\n",
    "* c. Final results of scaling (to 0.5x) original images (**1 image**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Report:\n",
    "* a. Discuss the results of blurred images and detected edges between different kernel sizes of Gaussian filter.\n",
    "* b. Discuss the difference between 3x3 and 30x30 window sizes of structure tensor.\n",
    "* c. Discuss the effect of non-maximal suppression.\n",
    "* d. Discuss the results of rotated and scaled image. Is Harris detector rotation-invariant or scale-invariant? Explain the reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Notice:\n",
    "* a. You should **NOT** use any functions which can get the result directly in each steps. (`cv2.Sobel`, `cv2.Laplacian`, `cv2.cornerHarris`, `skimg.feature.local_binary_pattern`, etc.)\n",
    "* b. Your code should display and output image results mentioned above.\n",
    "* c. You should provide a README file about your execution instructions."
